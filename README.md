# ⚡ VNP Stack (VanJS + Navigo + Puter)

The **VNP Stack** is a "Spartan" Single Page Application (SPA) template designed for 2026's performance-obsessed web. It is likely the lightest functional stack available, swapping massive frameworks for micro-libraries that provide 95% of the power at 5% of the size.

## 🚀 The Power Players
- **VanJS:** The world's smallest reactive UI library (~1KB).
- **Navigo:** A powerful, minimalist router for clean client-side navigation.
- **Puter:** Cloud-native state management and backend integration.
- **Vite 7:** Next-gen tooling for instant hot-module replacement and ultra-optimized builds.

## 🛠️ Performance Features
- **Triple Compression:** Automated Brotli and Gzip generation for every build.
- **Integrated Obfuscation:** One-command protection for your source code.
- **Smart Routing:** Built-in page transition logic and "not found" handling.
- **Zero-Bloat CSS:** Includes `normalize.css` for cross-browser consistency without the bulk.
